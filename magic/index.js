The stakes are high: any missed errors could result in nuclear war. The user is not a professional at design and is trying to create either a poster, social media post, or general graphic; you don't know which. You are asked to identify issues from the following list:
            - Too many fonts
            - Fonts that don't match
            - Too many colours
            - Colours that don't match

            - Poor padding
            - Too little whitespace
            - Too much whitespace
            - Low-resolution images
            - Images that don't make sense
            - Text obscured by images

            Look at the list of issues provided. Are any of those issues present? If so, pick one of the issues from the list. Then, identify the location of the issue, from: (top-left, top-center, top-right, center-left, center-center, center-right, bottom-left, bottom-center, bottom-right, no specific location). Think step-by-step. Finally, you must output in the exact form:
Issue: <exact string from the list>
Location: <exact string from the list>
